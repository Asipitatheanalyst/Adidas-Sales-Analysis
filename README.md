## Project Overview
This project analyzes Adidas sales data to gain insights into revenue trends, regional performance, product profitability, and sales methods. By leveraging *Excel Pivot Tables and Visualizations*, I aim to answer key business questions that can help optimize sales strategies, product pricing, and regional focus. The analysis focuses on identifying trends over time, assessing product and regional sales performance, and determining the best-performing sales methods. The final output includes *charts and KPIs* that provide actionable insights for Adidas.

## Data Source
The dataset for this project was sourced from *Kaggle*. It contains sales transactions across different regions, product categories, and sales methods, along with revenue and profit figures.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft *Excel* (Data cleaning, Pivot Tables, Conditional Formatting, Charts)

## Data Cleaning & Preparation
The dataset required the following cleaning steps:
- Removing duplicate records
- Handling missing values in sales and profit columns
- Converting data types for accurate calculations
- Standardizing product and region names
- Extracting relevant date components (year, quarter, month) for trend analysis

## Objectives
1. *Sales & Revenue Trends* - Is our sales improving over time? Are there any downward trends? Which months, quarters, or seasons see the highest and lowest sales?
2. *Regional & State Performance* - Which region and states perform best in terms of revenue?
3. *Product Performance & Pricing* - What are our best and worst-performing products? Are there optimal price points where we make the most profit?
4. *Best-Performing Retailer* - Which retailer consistently achieves the highest sales?
5. *Sales Methods Analysis* - Which sales method generates the most revenue and profit?
6. *Customer Buying Behaviour* - Do different region prefer different products?

## Results
- KPIs: The total revenue generated amounts to $320,166,650. A total of 9,644 units were sold. They were 6 Product Category. And 3 Sales Method.
- Sales Trends Over Time: The sales trend shows a significant increase, especially in the second half of the period. This suggests a seasonal demand or successful marketing strategies boosting sales during specific periods.
- Regional Performance: The highest sales were recorded in certain regions, while others lagged. This indicates varying market penetration and customer preferences across locations.
-  Sales Method Analysis: The majority of sales came from one specific method, while the others contributed less. This highlights the dominance of a particular sales channel, which is online sales.
-   Retailer Performance: Some retailers outperformed others significantly in terms of total units sold. West Gear and foot locker led sales, while others had relatively lower contributions.
-   Product Performance: Certain product categories generated the highest revenue, indicating their popularity. Categories like "Men’s Street Footwear" performed well, while others had lower sales figures.
-   Regional & State  Performance: West region has the highest total sales.

## Recommendations

1. Leverage High Sales Periods: Since there is a noticeable peak in sales at specific times, Adidas should focus on marketing campaigns and promotions during those high-performing periods to maximize revenue.
2. Strengthen Regional Presence: The regions with lower sales could benefit from targeted promotions, partnerships, or localized marketing efforts to boost revenue.
3. Optimize Sales Channels: Since one sales method dominates, Adidas should consider enhancing underperforming channels to diversify revenue streams.
4. Retailer-Specific Strategies: Supporting high-performing retailers with exclusive deals or better stock availability can help sustain their momentum. Lower-performing retailers may need additional incentives, training, or strategic partnerships to improve sales.
5. 5. Product Strategy: Adidas should focus on high-performing product categories while reassessing the lower-performing ones. This could involve discontinuing, rebranding, or repackaging less popular products

## Conclusion
The Adidas sales analysis provides valuable insights into sales performance across different regions, sales methods, retailers, and product categories. The data reveals clear trends, including peak sales periods, top-performing regions, and dominant sales channels. Leveraging these insights can help Adidas make data-driven decisions to optimize marketing strategies, enhance underperforming areas, and maximize profitability.

By capitalizing on high sales periods, strengthening weaker regions, and refining sales channel strategies, Adidas can further solidify its market position. Additionally, focusing on top-performing products while improving weaker ones will ensure a more balanced and profitable product portfolio.

Overall, this analysis serves as a foundation for strategic decision-making, enabling Adidas to improve customer engagement, boost sales, and drive sustainable business growth.
